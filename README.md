# INTRODUCTION
The dataset was used for the Onyx Data DNA Challenge for May 2025. I sourced it from the official Onyx [website](https://onyxdata.kit.com/datadna-apr-2025), performed initial cleaning, and imported it into MySQL for further data preparation and transformation.
# Project Objective:
Designed and executed a SQL-based analysis to uncover insights that improve healthcare decision-making, reduce operational costs, and enhance patient outcomes. The project explores patient care trends across hospitals, enabling stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions.
# Key Questions Answered in my Analysis:
Q1: What are the most common age groups, genders, and blood types among patients
> 
Q2: Are certain groups being admitted more often than others?
>
Q3: Which medical conditions are diagnosed the most, and do they affect certain groups of people more than others?
>
Q4: How long do patients typically stay in the hospital for different conditions? 
>
Q5: Does this vary depending on the hospital or type of admission (emergency, urgent, or planned)?
>
Q6: How much does treatment usually cost for each condition?
> 
Q7: Are there big differences in costs between hospitals or insurance providers?
>
Q8: Which hospitals are treating the most patients, and how do they compare in terms of patient outcomes, like test results?
>
Q9: What medications are most often prescribed for each condition?
 >
Q10: Are they being used consistently across hospitals?
>
Q11: How are patients admitted - mostly through emergency, urgent, or planned admissions - and how does that impact the length of stay or treatment costs?
>
Q12: Which insurance companies are covering the most patients, and how does that relate to treatment costs and patient outcomes?
>
Q13: Where are the hospitals located, and are there any regional differences in health conditions, treatment quality, or billing amounts?
